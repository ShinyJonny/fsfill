# Zbfill

Zero-fill unused space in file systems

## Description

Scans the file system for unused space and fills it with bytes.
Can be used for file systems within encryption layers like [dm-crypt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt) to encrypt all the blocks that were not touched by the file system and restore plausible deniability.

Currently supported file systems:
- Ext2
- Ext3
- Ext4

## Usage

To scan and fill a drive, run:
```
zbfill <DRIVE_PATH>
```

To specify the fill mode, use the `-f` or `--fill-mode` flags:
```
zbfill --fill-mode chacha20 <DRIVE_PATH>
```

To get the usage of the drive in JSON format, use either the `-r` or `--report-only` flags:
```
zbfill --report-only <DRIVE_PATH>
```

For more verbose log output use either the `-v` or `--verbose` flags (can be used multiple times for increased depth of verbosity):
```
zbfill -vv <DRIVE_PATH>
```

To store the informational output into a file, supply a log file with either the `-l` or `--log-file` flags:
```
zbfill -l <LOG_FILE_PATH> <DRIVE_PATH>
```

For more information on the usage and supported flags, use either the `-h` or `--help` flags:
```
zbfill --help
```
